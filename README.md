 All source code is inside the /source directory

## Pre-requisites
- node.js (version 8)
- npm (use Node Version Manager (nvm) to select Node version)
- gulp installed globally (Once you have npm installed run `npm install -g gulp`)

## Compiling
1. cd into base directory
2. `npm install` (make sure you're using Node 8!)
3. `gulp` to build a static html/js/css website into /build/
4. **OR** run `gulp watch` to build dev then run the site with live auto-preview of changes
5. Run site on a web server (otherwise icons won't load)
